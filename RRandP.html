        <h1>This page contains information on Routers, Redundancy, and Packets. </h1>
		<h2> What is router
			<p1>Router is a device that connects and forwards data packets to the internet. The router serves two primary functions. It forwards data packets to their intended IP address so it can manage traffic between these networks, and it can make multiple devices to use the same internet connection. Each packet needs to be guided to its specific destination, and the router helps direct data packets to their destination IP address.</p1>
		<h3> What is redundancy </h3> 
			<p1>Redundancy means they replicate so that they can prevent downtime if thereâ€™s a power outage, hardware malfunction, human error, system failure, cyber attack or else. It makes multiple pathways that data transmissions can take through network. So even if one path fails or is unavailable, we can use another pathway which works well.</p1>

		<h4> What is packet </h4>
			<p1>Packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data is divided into packets so that it can connect with each other. Packets make data transmissions more efficient and reliable.</p1>
